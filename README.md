## üìñ Usage Guide

### Getting Started
1. **Load Vocabulary**: Upload your GRE vocabulary CSV file using the sidebar
2. **Choose Study Mode**: Select from Flashcards, Quiz, or Context exercises
3. **Study Consistently**: The app automatically schedules optimal review intervals
4. **Monitor Progress**: Track your mastery with detailed statistics and visualizations

### Study Session Flow
- Each session intelligently combines new words with review words
- Answer accuracy and response time are automatically tracked
- Words you struggle with are scheduled for more frequent review
- Session summaries provide immediate feedback on your performance

### Understanding the Statistics
- **Mastered**: Words with a streak of 3+ correct answers
- **Learning**: Words you're making progress on (1-2 correct streak)
- **Difficult**: Words with high difficulty scores (‚â•7)
- **Accuracy Rate**: Overall percentage of correct answers

### Using Different CSV Files
- Upload new vocabulary files anytime using the sidebar
- The app automatically validates CSV format and required columns
- Switch between different vocabulary sets while preserving individual progress
- Download the example template if you need help with formatting

## üìã CSV File Format

Your vocabulary CSV must include these exact column headers:

```csv
word,definition,part_of_speech,example,word_in_sentence,blanked_example,form
```

**Example row:**
```csv
aberrant,markedly different from an accepted norm,adjective,"When the financial director started screaming and throwing food at his co-workers, the police had to come in to deal with his aberrant behavior.",aberrant,"When the financial director started screaming and throwing food at his co-workers, the police had to come in to deal with his <BLANK> behavior.",base
```

**Column descriptions:**
- `word`: The vocabulary word to learn
- `definition`: Clear, concise definition
- `part_of_speech`: Grammar category (noun, verb, adjective, etc.)
- `example`: Complete sentence using the word in context
- `word_in_sentence`: The specific form of the word used in the example
- `blanked_example`: Example sentence with the word replaced by `<BLANK>`
- `form`: Grammatical form used (base, plural, past tense, etc.)

## üîß Core Components

### WordManager
- Loads and manages vocabulary words with unique ID tracking
- Provides search functionality across words and definitions
- Handles word lookups by unique identifier

### ProgressTracker
- Tracks learning statistics for each word using unique IDs
- Implements spaced repetition scheduling
- Manages study streaks and session history
- Automatically saves progress to JSON file

### SpacedRepetitionScheduler
- Builds intelligent study sessions mixing new and review words
- Prioritizes words based on difficulty and review schedule
- Balances session composition for optimal learning

## üé® Customization

### Modifying Spaced Repetition Intervals
Edit the `calculate_next_review` method in `core.py`:
```python
def calculate_next_review(self, correct_count: int, incorrect_count: int, streak: int) -> datetime:
    # Adjust these hour values to change review frequency
    if incorrect_count > correct_count: hours = 4
    elif streak == 0: hours = 12
    elif streak == 1: hours = 24
    # ... continue customizing
```

### Changing Session Size and New Word Ratio
Modify the `get_review_session` parameters in `app.py`:
```python
st.session_state.scheduler.get_review_session(session_size=20, new_words_ratio=0.3)
```

### Styling and Themes
The app includes CSS for both light and dark themes. Modify the styles in `app.py` to customize:
- Color schemes
- Card layouts
- Button styles
- Typography
